/*Sieve of Eratosthenes
Given a number n, print all primes smaller than or equal to n. It is also given that n is a small number.
For example, if n is 10, the output should be “2, 3, 5, 7”. If n is 20, the output should be “2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19”.

The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n when n is smaller
than 10 million or so
